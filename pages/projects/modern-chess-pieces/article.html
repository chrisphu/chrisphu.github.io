        <p>While modern chess sets can be pretty, a common problem I have with some of them is the willingness of their designers in order to sacrifice piece readability to achieve minimalistic aesthetic goals. There is nothing inherently wrong about this â€“ I just personally feel strongly that the design of the pieces themselves should never contribute any sort of confusion to the game.</p>
        <p>So with that in mind, I designed my own modern chess set in hopes of successfully creating a sharp low poly look while keeping it easy for both players to immediately gauge the board state.</p>
