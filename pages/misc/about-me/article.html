        <p>Hello! I'm just someone who enjoys programming Unity games, CAD, <a href="https://www.printables.com/@Chris_367665">3D printing</a>, and playing video games/board games. Recently, I have also been learning <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/chrisphu">Norwegian BokmÃ¥l</a>.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2019 with a BSME. I am currently employed at the Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) as a mechanical engineer / simulation analyst. The majority of my day-to-day work involves modeling physical phenomena using CAD and FEA software.</p>
        <h2>Social</h2>
