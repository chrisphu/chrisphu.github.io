# About

Hi! My name is Chris and I am a mechanical engineer. In my free time, I enjoy programming games, CAD modeling, 3D printing, and playing video games/board games.

## Background

I graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2019 with a BSME. I am currently employed at the Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) as a mechanical engineer / simulation analyst. The majority of my day-to-day work involves modeling physical phenomena using CAD and FEA software.
