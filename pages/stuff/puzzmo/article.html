<p>I've been on a real kick lately with <a href="https://www.puzzmo.com/user/hi/chris">Puzzmo</a>. There's daily puzzles of several different types. Below is an <a href="https://www.puzzmo.com/press">embeddable version</a> of their Flipart game.</p>
<h2>Flipart</h2>
<p>Paraphrasing the official instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotate pieces to fill in the frame completely</li>
<li>Rotate pieces by tapping their pivots (the 4 dots)</li>
<li>Tap non-pivots to find which pivots they belong to</li>
</ul>
