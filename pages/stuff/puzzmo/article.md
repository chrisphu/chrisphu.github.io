I've been on a real kick lately with [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com/user/hi/chris). There's daily puzzles of several different types. Below is an [embeddable version](https://www.puzzmo.com/press) of their Flipart game.

## Flipart

Paraphrasing the official instructions:

- Rotate pieces to fill in the frame completely
- Rotate pieces by tapping their pivots (the 4 dots)
- Tap non-pivots to find which pivots they belong to
