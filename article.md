Welcome to my website! I document and write about my projects and interests here from time to time. This website itself is actually a project as it is mostly just bare-bones HTML and CSS hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/chrisphu/chrisphu.github.io).

The dates next to the links below are roughly when I completed (or shelved) the respective topic.
